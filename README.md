# Swift_SetList
Swift project for musicians to collect, edit setlists.

The actual state is very preliminary... Right now I just testing how core data, SwiftData and other backends are working, and what is supported by github CI without pain...

This branch actually tests, if latest framework and toolchain is available. (SwiftData requires macos v14)
